lately ive been thinking about leaving
disappearing
not existing
what do i have to live for
and insincere boy who doesnt care, who cares more about his games and electronics than someone he supposedly loves
what career? what grades? what education?
whats in my future? the life i planned for myself happy family in a home, love and dogs and birds, art and laughter. I cant see that anymore
if i had no family, I would have already peaced out
the only thing keeping me here is thinking about how sad theyll be. they dont deserve that
what do i have left
i dont want to be here anymore
i hate this
